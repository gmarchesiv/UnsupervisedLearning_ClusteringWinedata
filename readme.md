The data for this project corresponds to a chemical analysis of three types of wines grown in the  same region in Italy. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each type. The data was originally posted in the 

[UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine) 

It was adapted for clustering by Harry Wang by taking out the data type and posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/wine-dataset-for-clustering)

The goal for this project is to est the hypothesis that there are three varities of wine in the dataset using K-means and agglomerative clustering.
